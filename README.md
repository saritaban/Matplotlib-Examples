📊 Matplotlib Visualization Examples – Pyplot & Object-Oriented API
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates data visualization using Matplotlib in Python, covering both:

Pyplot API

Object-Oriented (OO) API

The examples include different types of data analysis:

Univariate Analysis (Numerical & Categorical)

Bivariate Analysis

Multivariate Analysis

The goal of this project is to understand how to create clear, structured, and insightful visualizations using Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

🎯 Objectives

Learn and implement Matplotlib using both APIs

Visualize different types of data distributions

Compare variables using different plot types

Understand when to use Pyplot vs Object-Oriented API

📊 Pyplot API Examples

The Pyplot API is simple and ideal for quick visualizations.

🔹 1️⃣ Univariate Analysis
📌 Numerical Data

Used to understand distribution of a single numeric variable.

Plots Covered:

Histogram

Boxplot

Line Plot

Purpose:

Identify distribution

Detect outliers

Understand spread and central tendency

📌 Categorical Data

Used to analyze frequency distribution of categories.

Plots Covered:

Bar Chart

Pie Chart

Purpose:

Compare category counts

Visualize proportions

🔹 2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis

Used to analyze relationship between two variables.

Plots Covered:

Scatter Plot

Line Plot

Bar Plot (Grouped)

Purpose:

Identify correlation

Compare trends

Observe patterns between variables

🔹 3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis

Used to analyze more than two variables simultaneously.

Plots Covered:

Multiple Line Plots

Grouped Bar Charts

Subplots

Correlation Visualization

Purpose:

Compare multiple categories

Analyze combined variable impact

Perform deeper exploratory data analysis

🏗 Object-Oriented (OO) API

The Object-Oriented API provides more control and flexibility for complex visualizations.

Key Concepts:

fig (Figure object)

ax (Axes object)

Multiple subplots

Custom styling and formatting

Why Use OO API?

Better for large projects

Easier customization

Cleaner code structure

Professional dashboard-style plots

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Matplotlib

NumPy

Pandas

📚 Key Learnings

Difference between Pyplot and OO API

When to use each visualization type

How to structure multiple plots using subplots

Customizing titles, labels, legends, and grids

Improving readability of charts

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add Seaborn comparisons

Include real-world datasets

Build mini visualization dashboard

Add styling themes

📌 Conclusion

This project strengthens foundational data visualization skills using Matplotlib and prepares for real-world data analysis tasks, dashboards, and reporting requirements.
